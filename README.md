# Blitzkrieg
Win war fast, win war smart

## What you need
- Selenium and Python
- Chromedriver according to your browser's version
- Put your username and password on the appropriate txt
- Put the classes you want on the appropriate txt, check name on the website

Just run it after that

If you don't know how to use this, that means you probably shouldn't

## Last Tested
Semester Ganjil 2021/2022 (real war)

## File Information
blitzkrieg.py - a faster but more volatile version

blitzkrieg++.py - slower but foolproof even if you fall asleep on it

## Good to know stuff
Warning: It can be stuck somewhat due to siak's new system. It is advisable to open multiple instances

Tips:
- Read the code first so you know what it does. You're a programmer, right?
- Make sure everything in matkul is unique to other classes available
- Turn on at least 10 minutes before the war
- Monitor it until it can login at least once. Continuous login thereafter should pose no trouble until a certain amount of time elapses
- Run multiple of the same and/or different ver. at the same time so at least one can succeed
- Only us this as an insurance, manual participation and monitoring is advised
